# Bookwyrm
Bookwyrm is a project developed in the context of the Fuzzy Sets class. The goal is to make a small app or plugin to help people find new fantasy book suggestions.

## Data

The dataset used in this project comes from the [StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/). This website provides detailed information and analytics about books. It aggregates user-generated impressions and reading experiences. In particular, it provides stattistics on how readers felt about each book, including:
- **Moods** (reflective, emotional, adventurous,...)
- **Pace** (slow, medium, fast)
- **Additional attributes** such as genre tags, content warnings, length and community ratings.
  
These features make StoryGraph the perfect ressource for building recommendation or classification systems.
